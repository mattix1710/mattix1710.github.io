OK!

Recently I've created writeups website in which I'm sharing my writeups of CTFs and various challenges from cybersec ðŸ˜Š

Today I've created another website ðŸ˜… dedicated to tips and tricks in Linux/Windows systems and overall cybersec industry. 

At first I want to connect the knowledge I gathered in my "Forensics WIKI" section of PUTrequest_ wiki site, but I want to expand on other topics, cover the rest of the `Cybersecurity` knowledge base and (maybe) track my progress in learning more of IT!

The time will tell.
