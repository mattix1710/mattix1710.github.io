Since being a member of PUTrequest_ student's club on PUT I've been wondering about some kind of cheatsheet or wikipedia website for all the commands, tips and list of programs that we are actively using during our meetings.

A few months back with the number of other leaders we've managed to create simple drafts of most important notes and tips. However the case went silent.

On 01.03.2024 I've started the Wiki (currently powered by GitHub pages and Mkdocs material) with the initial note and simple forensics cheatsheet.

Now I can happily say ðŸ¥³, that multiple other people have started to contribute to that project and I still have a lot of ideas, what else can we write there ðŸ¤”

If you, my dear friend, want to explore the wiki, here is the link:
