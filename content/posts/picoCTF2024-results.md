During past two weeks I attended a competition of picoCTF2024 with my team `POSTrequest_` we've managed to cover most of the challenges. I'm especially proud of myself solving 7/8 forensics challenges and 4 binary exploitation challenges!

I will upload the writeups of more advanced challenges on my website in a couple of next days!

This competition was a good one, just as all picoCTFs, and I can't wait to attend 2025 edition!
