Hello friend!

I'm Mateusz and welcome to my webpage.

Here I will occasionally share my experiences with new technologies and my journey with exploring cybersecurity world.

You are welcomed to see my writeups of the challenges and CTFs I've participated and solved! ðŸ˜‰

I'm currently working on creating a wiki website for my cybersecurity student's club and I hope, there will also be a lot to read and learn from that! (Especially in the digital forensics field)!
